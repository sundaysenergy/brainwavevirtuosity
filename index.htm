                Virtuosity: Mastering your Life through Neurofeedback</strong> offers
                personalized coaching using EEG biofeedback to learn attentional
                flexibility and the ability to self-regulate brainwave states
                for stress reduction, peak performance, and overall heightened
                functioning.</p>
              <p><strong>Do

                life? Does it feel like something is holding you back from the
                success and contentment you are looking for? </strong></p>
              <p>Dr. Vazquez provides brainwave training and optimal performance
                  coaching that goes straight to the source - your brain - where
                  all patterns that define &ldquo;you&rdquo; were first created,
                  reinforced and can be UPDATED. Brainwave patterns underlie
                  our various states of mind and influence our experience of
                  the internal and external world. Neurofeedback, or brainwave
                  biofeedback, enables communication with the brain that fine
                  tunes the mental states conducive to creativity, peak performance,
                  insight, relaxation, overall well-being and contentment. </p>

              <p>Brainwave Virtuosity is unique in that it deals both with
                  training mental state and the content of the mind, which are
                  intricately connected. Dr. Vazquez complements state training
                  with inner process work. As the client, you will be gently
                  guided to explore internal patterns of beliefs and images that
                  often define your life. Because these patterns are usually
                  outside of conscious awareness, you are bound to repeat them
                  until you are able to bring them to the surface of the mind
                  where they can be examined and updated. This unique process
                  of brainwave monitoring is an internal &ldquo;working&rdquo; meditation
                  and enables tremendous insight and transformation. </p>

                  brain is the ultimate instrument, and like all instruments,
                  it functions best when it is in tune - when the brainwaves
                  hum harmoniously. The good news is that learning to &ldquo;play&rdquo; the
                  brain doesn&rsquo;t take nearly as long as learning to play
                  a musical instrument &mdash; what&rsquo;s more, we already
                  own a unique and priceless brain without having to buy one!
                  Yet few of us invest the mere weeks or months of training in
                  our ultimate instrument that would help make every day feel
                  like a concert performance, pitch perfect, with graceful crescendos
                  and decrescendos instead of wild ups and downs, ill-timed sharps
                  and flats. Now, with portable neurofeedback technology, that
                  brainwave training is accessible for all of us. And as we become
                  virtuosos internally, our external life effortlessly improves.
                  We experience an expanded capacity for both life&rsquo;s challenges
                  and life&rsquo;s rewards.</p>

              work I have experienced with Dr. Anna Vazquez is one
              of the best things I have done for myself this year. Thoroughly knowledgeable
              and technically experienced, Dr. Vazquez is also equally compassionate
              and intuitive, qualities
              which I consider essential in anyone I work with now. I am exploring
              brainwave states
              for several reasons: to enhance my creative work as a writer and
              artist, and to give new depth and dimension to my longtime practice
              (over 40 years) of meditation. This was the
              piece I needed to take me to a new level. Something about actually
              seeing my brainwaves on the computer screen was validating to me
              like nothing else. I continue everyday to use techniques and apply
              insights I discovered with Dr. Vazquez. I feel my experiences with
              her have greatly contributed to recent breakthroughs in general in
              my spiritual growth and specifically in my creativity. I would recommend
              her wholeheartedly.
