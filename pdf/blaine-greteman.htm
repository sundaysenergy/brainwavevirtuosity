                  <h1>How You Can Train
                    Your Brain to Help Reduce Stress
                  </h1>
                  <p>By Blaine Greteman, Ode. </p>
                  <p><strong>Neurofeedback is an emerging method that relaxes, enhances
                    creativity and improves mental health. </strong></p>
                  <p>As Vicki Wyatt attaches electrodes to my scalp with a generous
                    glop of slimy goo, I'll admit I'm a little skeptical about
                    the calming effects of the treatment I'm about to experience.
                    With newborn twins at home, I usually have enough slime in
                    my life and on my clothes to push anyone over the abyss.
                    But that, says Wyatt, is precisely why I could benefit from
                    neurofeedback, a therapeutic tool that advocates claim can
                    reshape our brains&mdash;and our lives.</p>
                  <p>To learn more about the procedure, I've come to The Wyatt
                    Clinic in downtown Oklahoma City. Just blocks from the memorial
                    that marks the site of the 1995 federal building bombing,
                    the location is aptly associated, in my mind, with both psychic
                    trauma and healing. This is a gentrifying but hardscrabble
                    neighborhood where Wyatt treats patients, from overstressed
                    professionals to addicts trying to get back on their feet.
                    Wyatt has been a therapist for 22 years, with a research
                    background at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences
                    Center, but she has only recently embraced neurofeedback
                    as part of her treatment regimen. &quot;My formal education
                    didn't really provide any alternative treatments,&quot; she
                    says. &quot;It was traditional psychotherapy and talk therapy.
                    When I look back, I think this would have benefited a lot
                    of the children and families earlier in my career.&quot;</p>
                  <p>The equipment looks fairly unexceptional, including the
                    electrodes, which could pass for iPod headphones and are
                    glued strategically to my head and temples. Wyatt clips a &quot;ground
                    wire&quot; to my ear. The wires run from the electrodes to
                    a black amplifier box the size of a small paperback. This
                    deceptively simple-looking piece of machinery, which can
                    cost several thousand dollars, processes electrical signals
                    from my brain and sends them to a laptop, where they're represented
                    graphically on the screen. Wyatt boots the laptop, opens
                    a neurofeedback training software program and settles me
                    into one of the comfy chairs that make her cozy, carpeted
                    office look more like my mother's living room than the white-tiled
                    clinic I'd expected.</p>
                  <p>After Wyatt hooks me up, I'll use my brain waves to control
                    a video game. When I achieve the desired mental state, a
                    small red bug will move around the screen eating flowers
                    and emitting a happy chirping sound. To succeed at the game,
                    I must eliminate brain waves that interfere with relaxed
                    concentration&mdash;those associated with hyperactivity,
                    depression and that all-too-familiar feeling of &quot;zoning
                    out.&quot;</p>
                  <p>I'm coming off a sleepless night of diaper-changing, rocking
                    and feeding, so focus isn't exactly my forte right now. But
                    after watching the bug languish sadly for a few minutes,
                    I begin to practice some deep, yogic breathing and try to
                    stop my racing thoughts about work, home and deadlines. Sure
                    enough, the band representing my desired brain activity jumps
                    and the red bug begins to rouse himself from his stupor,
                    eat a few flowers and chirp with approval.</p>
                  <p>After years on the outskirts of medical respectability,
                    neurofeedback has been vindicated by a growing body of evidence
                    showing its potentially remarkable benefits to everyone from
                    elite athletes and musicians to violent criminals and children
                    with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The
                    U.S. National Library of Medicine's database of scholarly
                    articles, for example, contains dozens of positive scientific
                    studies on neurofeedback published in the last two years.
                    The results, from some of the world's top universities and
                    research hospitals, suggest that neurofeedback is a promising
                    treatment for a range of cognitive health issues: seizures,
                    low IQ in kids with learning difficulties, vertigo and tinnitus
                    in the elderly, and substance abuse, even with notoriously
                    addictive, destructive drugs like crack cocaine.</p>
                  <p>Advocates say neurofeedback has emotional benefits as well. &quot;You
                    feel very good on this,&quot; says John Gruzelier, a professor
                    of psychology at the University of London's Goldsmiths College.
                    And all these effects are generated by the patient's brain,
                    not by drugs. No wonder some proponents describe neurofeedback's
                    effects in spiritual, as well as physical, terms.</p>
                  <p>It all starts with those slimy electrodes attached to the
                    scalp, which pick up a small part of the electrical symphony
                    produced continually in our brains. Neurons, the billions
                    of cells that make up our cerebral cortex and nervous system,
                    transmit information by firing electrical and chemical signals
                    across synapses, the junctions where they meet. These tiny
                    electrical pulses are central to our consciousness and bodily
                    lives: Each time our hearts beat, we blink at a bright light
                    or smile at a bit of good news, that action requires a flurry
                    of electrical activity.</p>
                  <p>The brain's electrical impulses take the form of waves that
                    researchers categorize by frequency&mdash;the number of times
                    they repeat each second (see &quot;Making waves&quot; box).
                    The slowest are the delta waves, which the brain typically
                    produces during deep sleep. Next are theta waves, another
                    slow undulation at four to eight cycles per second, often
                    associated with creative and subconscious thought, which
                    we produce when we're sleepy or daydreaming. We make alpha
                    waves of eight to 12 cycles per second when we're alert and
                    relaxed, and still-faster beta waves when we engage in active
                    problem-solving or become alert or anxious. The fastest patterns,
                    above 30 cycles per second, are made by gamma waves&mdash;usually
                    faint and difficult to detect, but associated with high-level
                    thought.</p>
                  <p>An overabundance or deficiency at one of these frequencies
                    often correlates to conditions such as depression and other
                    emotional disturbances and learning disabilities. Children
                    with ADHD, for example, often have too many slow brain waves
                    (delta or theta) and not enough of the faster waves that
                    allow them to focus, engage and think productively.</p>
                  <p>Neurofeedback reads these waves, feeds them into a computer
                    and translates them into visual form&mdash;in my case, the
                    ladybug's states of lethargy correlate to levels of electrical
                    activity in my brain. The underlying principle is that by
                    seeing your brain waves you can gain control over them, training
                    your brain to produce desired levels of activity, much like
                    you train your voice to produce certain musical notes. And
                    once those brain waves are in play, the desired brain state
                    comes with them. If, for example, you've got too much anxiety-producing
                    beta, try inducing some theta to calm down.</p>
                  <p>That might sound like trippy science fiction, but it's based
                    on technology that's been around since the German psychiatrist
                    Hans Berger began using electrodes to measure and categorize
                    human brain waves in the 1920s. The recordings of the human
                    brain-wave activity produced by this technology&mdash;electroencephalography,
                    or EEG&mdash;are the cornerstone of neurofeedback. By the
                    1970s, it was possible to feed that information back to patients
                    who heard a rewarding tone when they produced a pre-selected
                    frequency of brain waves. What's new is both the sophistication
                    of the feedback display and the precision with which therapists
                    can target different parts of the brain wave spectrum. On
                    top of that, neurofeedback has become cheaper, more efficient
                    and more readily applicable to a vast array of brain disorders.</p>
                  <p>&quot;When I was doing quantified EEG back in the 1970s,
                    computers were the size of filing cabinets,&quot; says James
                    R. Evans, a former University of South Carolina psychology
                    professor and current clinician at the Sterlingworth Center
                    in Greenville, South Carolina. Evans, who has written and
                    edited dozens of articles and books on neurofeedback and
                    is a consulting editor to one of the field's flagship publications,
                    The Journal of Neurotherapy, says those technological hurdles
                    limited neurofeedback's therapeutic reach in the early years: &quot;You
                    had to have a large-scale grant to afford the equipment and
                    electrical engineering people to keep it going.&quot;</p>
                  <p>By the early 1990s, the same technology that brought us
                    personal computers and Xboxes had changed all that, and without
                    huge research investments therapists could focus specifically
                    on brain waves that correlate to mental states. A quantified
                    EEG could show that a patient's brain contained waves outside
                    the normal range, and new software made it easier to create
                    training protocols or use existing ones to boost or reduce
                    activity across a frequency or region of the brain. Neurofeedback
                    began to gain a devoted following of patients and clinicians
                    who swore by its effects. Martin Wuttke is one of those clinicians,
                    a neurofeedback pioneer known for getting remarkable results&mdash;starting
                    with himself.</p>
                  <p>A former heroin addict, Wuttke discovered meditation could
                    help him beat the drugs, and soon he was running meditation
                    and counseling sessions for other addicts. &quot;I found
                    that the key to recovering from addiction was a spiritual
                    experience,&quot; Wuttke says. &quot;That's what the Twelve
                    Steps [of Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous] are all about,
                    but I felt like that had gotten lost.&quot; To facilitate
                    that experience and give it credibility by grounding it in
                    science, Wuttke turned to neurofeedback.</p>
                  <p>Alcoholics and drug addicts often have too many fast brain
                    waves&mdash;which is perhaps why they seek a chemical fix
                    to calm and soothe overactive brains, he says. With the right
                    technology, neurofeedback practitioners believe they can
                    wake up parts of the brain that are too sleepy and calm down
                    regions that are spinning out of control.</p>
                  <p>For Wuttke, the results were life-changing. As people moved
                    through his program, he says, &quot;Their depressions went
                    away, their pains went away, their anxieties went away.&quot; Wuttke
                    believes patients become less likely to backslide once they
                    realize they have access to inner calm without drugs or alcohol,
                    an insight he describes in terms of &quot;awakening.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Neurofeedback's potential hit home when Wuttke's son, Jacob,
                    was born with brain injuries and major developmental problems. &quot;At
                    age 2, he had no muscle tone and some severe difficulties,&quot; says
                    Wuttke, &quot;but the pediatric neurologist couldn't give
                    us any answer about why or how to treat him.&quot; Wuttke
                    and his wife at the time, Amy O'Dell, took matters into their
                    own hands, developing a comprehensive treatment regime incorporating
                    neurofeedback.Facing the difficulties of asking a child so
                    young to control his brain waves, Wuttke and O'Dell observed
                    the feedback screen and stimulated their son when his brain
                    produced the desired patterns. &quot;We would be very quiet
                    when his brain wasn't within parameters, and then when it
                    was, we would squeeze him and say, 'Good work!' and orient
                    his brain to those moments.&quot;</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of the process, Wuttke describes his toddler
                    son as &quot;hypotonic&quot;: unable to sit on his own or
                    hold his head upright. But &quot;within 60 days, his brain
                    started to come alive,&quot; Wuttke says, and this cognitive
                    awakening was the first step in a process that soon had his
                    son crawling, walking and running. After witnessing the results,
                    Wuttke and O'Dell established Jacob's Ladder, a school for
                    developmentally challenged children in Atlanta, Georgia,
                    run by O'Dell. Although Jacob couldn't retain five letters
                    of the alphabet at age 6, by age 14 he was reading at a 12th
                    grade level, and the school had achieved national recognition.</p>
                  <p>That experience helped Wuttke formulate his &quot;neurodevelopmental&quot; approach,
                    in which he uses exercise, dietary supplements and neurofeedback
                    in concert to establish and rewire broken pathways in the
                    brain. Since then, Wuttke has trained thousands of neurofeedback
                    practitioners and garnered a cadre of patients who describe
                    neurofeedback in transformative terms.</p>
                  <p>Beth Black, for example, fairly raves about the way Wuttke's
                    neurofeedback regimen impacted her 7-year-old son. &quot;Ethan's
                    a completely different kid now,&quot; she says. When Black
                    adopted Ethan at 5 months old, he'd already endured severe
                    neglect and suspected pre-natal drug use by his mother, so
                    it wasn't entirely surprising that the boy faced challenges.
                    Still, by the time he entered first grade at age 6 it was
                    clear to Black, director of the Family Art Therapy Center
                    in Clayton, Georgia, that Ethan's problems were cause for
                    serious concern. &quot;We first noticed that when you teased
                    him, he wouldn't understand or react normally, but would
                    have these explosive tantrums,&quot; she explains.</p>
                  <p>Failing socially and academically, Ethan hated school despite
                    the efforts of his teachers and his mother to implement a
                    program of special instruction and behavioral therapy. &quot;He
                    said no one liked him and he wanted to die, and when he would
                    get really upset he would have to exhaust himself before
                    he could get control,&quot; Black recalls. A child psychologist
                    labeled Ethan with ADHD and prescribed medication, but Black
                    was desperate to avoid drugs and turned to Wuttke instead.
                    Using an evaluative brain-wave scan, Wuttke determined that
                    Ethan lacked normal levels of beta, the relatively fast waves
                    associated with attention and concentrated thought.</p>
                  <p>They implemented a training program of neurofeedback and
                    listening therapy to boost this band and improve the boy's
                    concentration, and within two weeks Black was a believer. &quot;For
                    the first time ever, he could tell me a story in sequence;
                    within three weeks, he was scoring 100s on his spelling tests
                    and just blowing us and his teachers away.&quot; After seven
                    weeks, Ethan was able to calm himself, and the explosive
                    anger was a thing of the past.</p>
                  <p>Black was so impressed that she applied for a grant to use
                    neurofeedback with the juvenile offenders sent to her clinic
                    regularly for court-assigned behavioral therapy. Counseling
                    these young offenders had been &quot;a waste of money,&quot; according
                    to Black, but the seven juvenile offenders who entered the
                    program of intensive neurofeedback therapy flourished.</p>
                  <p>&quot;The judge came to us at the end of this program,&quot; Wuttke
                    remembers, &quot;and said, 'What did you do to these kids?'&quot; Within
                    weeks those who'd dropped out were back in school, performing
                    so well on standardized tests that their learning disabilities
                    seemed to have disappeared.</p>
                  <p>Such stories abound. &quot;Our whole family was in trouble
                    because of my daughter's depression and discipline problems,&quot; says
                    Joann Bullard, whose daughter received treatment at Wuttke's
                    clinic in the Netherlands. &quot;She was going to have to
                    go on medication because there just weren't any other options,&quot; Bullard
                    says, but after 60 sessions of neurotherapy, &quot;there
                    was a total turnaround, and we're grateful every day.&quot; Another
                    father, Ben Odukwe, says he visited specialists around the
                    world after his son Onura was diagnosed with mild autism,
                    but saw no real results until the boy entered Jacob's Ladder
                    school and began a neurofeedback program under Wuttke's supervision.
                    Onura's father notes that the boy's &quot;communication,
                    his confidence, his handwriting and dexterity all transformed,&quot; and
                    at age 16, he's entering mainstream school for the first
                    time.</p>
                  <p>Neurofeedback doesn't cure conditions like ADHD, depression
                    or addiction. Instead, it enables people to produce the appropriate
                    brain waves, which helps provide the attention, rest or contemplative
                    awareness needed to deal with underlying issues. You can't
                    manufacture these brain waves by force of will. I quickly
                    discovered that success comes from letting go. &quot;It's
                    not a conscious thing,&quot; Wuttke emphasizes. You have
                    to &quot;surrender to the process [and] let your brain take
                    over. You are going to deep parts of the brain and neutralizing
                    disruptive brain waves, and often in this extreme state of
                    quietude, key memories and patterns come up, almost like
                    you're in a half dream state, and there's sort of a rewiring
                    that occurs.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Wuttke likes to say our brain tends to follow certain &quot;scripts,&quot; patterns
                    of thought that take us to the same place over and over.
                    Neurofeedback, as it forges new pathways in the brain, helps
                    us devise new scripts.</p>
                  <p>Even as the technology has advanced and the success stories
                    have grown into a rich anecdotal lore, however, neurofeedback
                    continues to face skepticism and resistance from parts of
                    the medical establishment. It has only begun to gain widespread
                    acceptance as a therapeutic tool recently. &quot;It was an
                    up-and-coming treatment modality in the 1970s,&quot; says
                    Evans, who has worked with the technology in academic and
                    clinical settings. But he says neurofeedback lost scientific
                    credibility when the early, simple equipment was adopted
                    by and became associated with &quot;hippies&quot; in pursuit
                    of &quot;instant Zen.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Neurofeedback still has its skeptics among consumers too,
                    especially since it remains unregulated; anyone who can afford
                    the equipment can rent an office, hang a shingle and treat
                    patients (see &quot;How to choose a neurofeedback practitioner&quot; box
                    on page 51). Today, however, Evans says, &quot;We've reached
                    a tipping point where there are hardcore science people working
                    in neurofeedback and articles being published in good journals,
                    and it's becoming much more difficult for mainstream medicine
                    to ignore. No one can say any longer that there is no science
                    behind it.&quot;</p>
                  <p>The studies that have generated the most enthusiasm are
                    the ones suggesting that the treatment offers a drug-free
                    alternative for children with ADHD. A review of the scientific
                    literature in 2005, for example, noted that 75 percent of
                    kids with ADHD treated with neurofeedback improved&mdash;compared
                    to about 70 percent treated with drugs&mdash;and no study
                    has reported negative effects. A 2007 study from the University
                    Hospital of T&uuml;bingen in Germany showed that after a
                    treatment regime lasting several months, children diagnosed
                    with ADHD not only improved their behavior and increased
                    their ability to concentrate &quot;significantly,&quot; but
                    added nearly 10 points to their IQs&mdash;a result maintained
                    six months after the study ended.</p>
                  <p>Skeptics have long argued that the benefits of neurofeedback
                    to children with ADHD could be attributed to the placebo
                    effect&mdash;or that the children could achieve similar improvement
                    if they spent the same amount of time working with parents
                    on focused tasks like assembling puzzles. By this logic,
                    it isn't the technology of neurofeedback that helps children
                    with ADHD, but the attention and effort of parents and therapists
                    working in concert to support learning and concentration.
                    To find out the truth, Swiss researchers at the University
                    of Zurich created a controlled study to isolate neurofeedback
                    from other factors. One group of children with ADHD was given
                    neurofeedback, while another entered an intensive behavioral
                    therapy program that used traditional techniques to teach
                    them to focus. The results were dramatic: Children in the
                    neurofeedback trial improved markedly on indices of attention
                    and &quot;metacognition&quot; (the awareness of one's mental
                    processes), whereas children in the behavioral therapy group
                    showed no significant improvement.</p>
                  <p>But there was just one caveat. The researchers noted that
                    the results seemed &quot;mediated by unspecific factors,
                    such as parental support or certain properties of the therapeutic
                    setting and content.&quot; So, while neurofeedback works,
                    it isn't a magic bullet&mdash;parental support and the right
                    clinical setting, which might include other therapies, are
                    key to realizing its potential.</p>
                  <p>Importantly, however, that potential goes beyond the treatment
                    of disorders. Indeed, neurofeedback seems remarkably effective
                    at improving mental focus and concentration, even for apparently &quot;normal&quot; individuals. &quot;We've
                    just done a study training eye surgeons,&quot; says Gruzelier
                    of Goldsmiths College in London, &quot;and we found that
                    the rhythm that's very effective in reducing hyperactivity
                    in ADHD children also helped enhance surgical performance
                    by 20 percent.&quot; The aim was to do the surgery as quickly
                    and accurately as possible, and neurofeedback training, which
                    enhanced beta waves while relaxing the cerebral cortex to
                    reduce hyperactive movements, seemed to enhance surgeons'
                    ability to modulate their performance. &quot;Instead of just
                    charging at the target,&quot; Gruzelier says, &quot;they
                    were actually slightly longer and more methodical in their
                    preparatory time, then faster and more accurate on task.&quot;</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Athletes and performers often associate such success with
                    being &quot;in the zone.&quot; Many athletes believe neurofeedback
                    allows them to pause racing thoughts and live wholly in the
                    moment of the game. Prominent among them is Chris Kamen,
                    the center for the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team,
                    who was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and struggled in his
                    early career, despite his imposing seven-foot height. In
                    2007, he discovered neurofeedback and soon improved his scoring
                    and rebounding by more than 50 percent. As important, Kamen
                    says, his life off the court improved as he stopped making
                    impulsive decisions.</p>
                  <p>Kamen not only attributed the success to neurofeedback,
                    but became a spokesperson for Hope139, a Michigan company
                    dedicated to bringing neurofeedback technology into schools
                    and businesses to improve performance. Neurofeedback has
                    gained such a lustrous reputation that the Italian professional
                    soccer team A.C. Milan has created a glassed-in &quot;mind
                    room,&quot; where the team gathers for mental tune-ups. In
                    the mind room, players watch their brain waves play out across
                    a computer screen while a team of sports psychologists monitors
                    their progress.</p>
                  <p>Gruzelier emphasizes that neurofeedback's performance-enhancing
                    results go beyond relaxation or the relief of anxiety&mdash;effects
                    that might be achieved with sedatives or more conventional
                    relaxation techniques. &quot;We've compared this to other
                    techniques that have reduced anxiety but have not enhanced
                    performance in the same way,&quot; says Gruzelier, citing
                    his studies of professional dancers and musicians who did
                    neurofeedback training to quiet the brain's fast-wave activity
                    and produce more slow theta waves. These studies showed remarkable
                    improvements &quot;not only in artistry, but communication,
                    the way people expressed themselves, the presence they have
                    on stage.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Elite students at the Royal College of Music in London improved
                    their performance an average 17 percent, according to a panel
                    of independent judges, and competitive ballroom dancers achieved &quot;professionally
                    significant&quot; improvement in just five weeks. Moreover,
                    Gruzelier notes his recent research hasn't only replicated
                    these results, but shown they extend to novice performers. &quot;There
                    are dramatic improvements,&quot; he says. &quot;Breath and
                    pitch improve. Where they didn't sing in tune to begin with,
                    they did afterwards.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Gruzelier attributes such results to the technology's ability
                    to allow slow waves to travel farther, uninterrupted, across
                    the brain. That facilitates interaction between areas of
                    the brain that don't typically connect, he says. Normally,
                    such a process is disrupted by the fast waves that characterize
                    our waking life&ndash;a kind of mental static. &quot;It's
                    been known for centuries that the hypnagogic experience,
                    the border between waking and sleeping, is the source of
                    remarkable insights,&quot; Gruzelier says.</p>
                  <p>Neurofeedback's apparent ability to bring those insights
                    into the light, however, is what seems remarkable, especially
                    since we still don't understand key factors about how it
                    works&mdash;how, for example, people control their own brain
                    waves. &quot;It's very much a black box,&quot; explains John
                    Kounios, a professor of psychology at Drexel University in
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
                  <p>Kounios conducted a double-blind study of elderly subjects
                    that showed neurofeedback may help improve cognitive processing
                    speed and &quot;executive function,&quot; the mental operations
                    that help us plan and organize our lives, but he admits the
                    cognitive process underlying neurofeedback is still something
                    of a mystery. &quot;Although neurofeedback has been around
                    for 40 years, we still don't have the slightest clue as to
                    how people do this,&quot; Kounios says. &quot;It's not as
                    if there aren't any good theories. There are just no theories,
                    not even bad ones&ndash;just the observation that this is
                    something animals and humans can do.&quot;</p>
                  <p>That sometimes makes for surprising results, as in the case
                    of Kounios' study, which increased the production of alpha
                    waves in the frontal lobes of elderly people. The frontal
                    lobe often deteriorates as people age, which makes problem-solving,
                    abstract reasoning and all kinds of planning more difficult.
                    And so, as Kounios' subjects boosted their alpha activity
                    in this region of the brain, they demonstrated an improved
                    ability to respond when presented with new information and
                    to make quick decisions in cognitive tests. Such results
                    are preliminary but exciting. Kounios emphasizes that the
                    field needs funding for large-scale studies that can establish
                    the basic science of neurofeedback and determine which training
                    protocols are most effective, &quot;but there's no question
                    in my mind that this has significant potential and the phenomena
                    are real.&quot;</p>
                  <p>This is a common refrain among researchers and practitioners. &quot;It
                    works,&quot; agrees Evans. &quot;Almost anybody can get the
                    equipment and get 60 percent good results. The question is,
                    what are those people doing who get 90 percent? Some people
                    give vitamins along with their treatment; others pray with
                    clients or use counseling. In many respects, these people
                    fire a shotgun and we don't know which pellets hit.&quot;</p>
                  <p>That's why Wuttke is creating an institution that will train
                    a core group of people who can replicate his results and
                    methods. His mission is to establish a network of neurofeedback
                    clinics and training facilities in Europe through his work

                  <p>&quot;One of the biggest risks right now is that this becomes
                    a novelty, where people can buy some software and hook into
                    it at home and play a game,&quot; says Wuttke. &quot;That's
                    going to happen, but it takes away from the profound clinical
                    applications, which have to be part of a more comprehensive
                    approach.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Wyatt agrees. &quot;For most patients, whether they're suffering
                    from depression or post-traumatic stress syndrome, I don't
                    believe that neurofeedback offers a complete solution any
                    more than I believe a doctor can give you a drug that offers
                    a complete solution. Neurofeedback can calm the brain down,
                    but then you still often have to deal with underlying issues.&quot;</p>
                  <p>The desire to get at those underlying issues is why Wuttke,
                    an ordained non-denominational minister, keeps coming back
                    to the notion of spiritual growth. &quot;When you incorporate
                    all these things and straighten out the brain, the ultimate
                    goal is for people's spiritual awareness to start manifesting
                    itself,&quot; he says. Indeed, recent studies of Tibetan
                    Buddhist monks by Richard Davidson, director of the Lab for
                    Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
                    have shown links between spirituality and the processes encouraged
                    by neurofeedback. In particular, monks who are experts in
                    meditation seem capable of generating extraordinary levels
                    of gamma waves as they achieve a state typically associated
                    with &quot;transcendence.&quot;</p>
                  <p>From a materialist perspective, the key seems to be neurofeedback's
                    ability to help us connect memories and sense perceptions
                    that have been laid down in disparate regions of the brain&mdash;to
                    achieve the feeling of unified consciousness by unifying
                    the brain's electrical impulses. But if neurofeedback can
                    foster and even enhance such a state, this begs the question
                    of whether the phenomena we typically describe in terms of &quot;spirituality&quot; are
                    just physical by-products of a material mind.</p>
                  <p>Wuttke turns such skepticism on its head. &quot;The way
                    I look at it,&quot; he says, &quot;we may be able to map
                    an experience through physiology, whether it is a profound
                    sense of peace or a religious sense, but that doesn't mean
                    the material brain is the source of those experiences.&quot; Instead,
                    he sees the brain as &quot;a transformer, something that
                    conducts energy between metaphysical and physical reality.&quot; He
                    admits neurofeedback can't necessarily help any Joe off the
                    street achieve the transcendence of a Tibetan yogi, but adds, &quot;It
                    has been my experience that everybody is enlightened; they
                    just don't know it.&quot;</p>
                  <p>After my first session of neurofeedback therapy, there's
                    little chance I'll be confused with one of the enlightened&mdash;something
                    my wife readily confirms. But as I watched the red bug move
                    with increasing dexterity about the screen, it certainly
                    felt empowering to see how much control we can exert over
                    our minds, moods and selves. Over the next few weeks, it's
                    a sensation I'll recall during moments of stress, like the
                    long nights with my ever-wakeful children. Just this recollection
                    seems to have some tangible effect, slowing the quickening
                    pulse and quieting the static I've seen in the graphic representations
                    of my brain waves. As Wuttke would say, we can sometimes
                    be locked into old scripts, reacting to our world in ways
                    we don't understand or seem to control. Neurofeedback's potential
                    is so inspiring, in part, because it can help us rescript
                    our brains and, thus, rewrite our lives.</p>
